# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. Created by Facebook (now Meta), React has become one of the most popular frontend frameworks in the world.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Key Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They're like JavaScript functions that return HTML elements (JSX).

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

### JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

### Props

Props (short for properties) are how you pass data from parent components to child components.

### State

State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time in your component.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js** - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. **Create a new React app** - Use Create React App to set up your development environment
3. **Start coding** - Begin building your first React component

## Next Steps

Once you understand these basics, you can explore more advanced topics like:

- React Hooks
- Context API
- React Router
- State management with Redux

Happy coding!
