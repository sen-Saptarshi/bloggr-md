# 🐳 Is Docker Secretly Eating My Disk Space?

Let’s be honest — Docker is awesome, but sometimes it feels like a black box that quietly devours your disk space while you’re not looking.

If you've ever had this paranoid thought:

> _“Why is my C drive full even though I killed all my containers?”_

You're not alone. Killing a container with `docker kill <container_id>` **does not remove its data**, and that’s just the start of it.

## 🧠 Understanding Docker's Storage Layers

Here’s what actually happens behind the scenes when you use Docker — and why your storage might be bloated:

### 1. 🧱 Image Layers

- Every `docker pull` or `docker build` action creates image layers.
- These layers are **cached locally**, even after a container is stopped or deleted.
- Multiple containers might share layers, but unused layers stick around unless removed manually.

### 2. 📦 Container Data (Writable Layers)

- When you run a container, Docker creates a **writable layer** on top of the image.
- It stores logs, runtime data, temporary files, etc.
- Killing or stopping a container doesn’t delete this layer — it just marks it as “stopped.”

## 🧹 Reclaiming Your Disk Space

Here’s how to clean up Docker's leftovers and reclaim that sweet, sweet SSD space:

### 🔸 1. Remove Unused (Dangling) Images

**Check for dangling images:**

```bash
docker images -f "dangling=true"
```

**Remove them:**

```bash
docker image prune
```

You can go even further with:

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

> ⚠️ This removes **all unused** images, not just the dangling ones.

---

### 🔸 2. Remove Stopped Containers

**See all containers (running or stopped):**

```bash
docker ps -a
```

**Remove all stopped ones:**

```bash
docker container prune
```

---

### 🔸 3. Clean Up Volumes

Volumes can pile up without you noticing.

**List all volumes:**

```bash
docker volume ls
```

**Remove unused volumes:**

```bash
docker volume prune
```

Or target a specific one:

```bash
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```

---

### 🔸 4. Bonus: Remove Unused Networks

Yup, those pile up too!

```bash
docker network prune
```

## 🛡️ Pro Tips to Keep Docker Clean

- **Automate Cleanup:** Run a regular cron job or script to prune unused Docker resources.
- **Use Docker Compose** for multi-container apps; it's easier to manage and clean up.
- **Use Named Volumes** instead of anonymous ones so you can track and manage them better.
- **Avoid \:latest in Production** – tagging images properly avoids accidental layer duplication.
- **Understand Storage Drivers** (like Overlay2): the default driver might not suit your system’s performance or space requirements.

## 🔍 TL;DR

| Cleanup Command          | Docker Resources Removed |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `docker image prune`     | Dangling Images          |
| `docker image prune -a`  | All Unused Images        |
| `docker container prune` | Stopped Containers       |
| `docker volume prune`    | Unused Volumes           |
| `docker network prune`   | Unused Networks          |

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Docker isn’t secretly malicious — but it _is_ quietly persistent.
If you're working on many projects or rebuilding images frequently, **periodic cleanup is essential** to avoid turning your machine into a landfill of containers and volumes.

Stay paranoid. Stay clean. 🧼
And if you’re still suspicious... try this:

```bash
docker system df
```

It’ll show you exactly where Docker is hoarding your disk space.
