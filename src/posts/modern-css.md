# Modern CSS Techniques Every Developer Should Know

CSS has evolved tremendously over the past few years. With new features and techniques constantly being added, it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

## CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that makes it easy to create complex layouts with just a few lines of code.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Flexbox

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts and aligning items within containers.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

CSS variables make your stylesheets more maintainable and dynamic.

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
  --secondary-color: #2ecc71;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

## Container Queries

Container queries allow you to apply styles based on the size of a container rather than the viewport.

```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

## CSS Logical Properties

Logical properties provide better support for different writing modes and internationalization.

```css
.element {
  margin-inline-start: 20px;
  padding-block: 10px;
}
```

## Modern Selectors

New CSS selectors give you more precise control over styling.

```css
/* :has() selector */
.card:has(img) {
  border: 2px solid #ddd;
}

/* :is() selector */
:is(h1, h2, h3) {
  color: var(--heading-color);
}
```

## Conclusion

These modern CSS techniques can significantly improve your development workflow and the quality of your web designs. Start incorporating them into your projects today!
